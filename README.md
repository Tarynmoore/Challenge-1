Problems in the starter code 

HTML
When given the starter code it did not meet accessibility standards. 
The starter code had too many <div>'s, no proper header/footer, no <alt> attributes, and no descriptive tite. 
There were random #id tags that weren't necessary. 


What was done in HTML
I put the code into <section>'s to make it easer to read through. 
I put proper <alt> attributes by the images to make more accesible. 
I put proper header/footer's and a descriptive title to give it the best search engine optimization. 
Removed non needed #id tags. 

CSS
There was no descriptions
